-- Fix: Add DELETE policy to profiles table
-- Allow users to delete their own profile (GDPR compliance)
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Note on public_models view:
-- Views in PostgreSQL cannot have RLS policies applied directly.
-- The view relies on the underlying models table RLS policies for security.
-- Since the view only exposes a subset of columns (excluding user_id),
-- and the models table has proper RLS policies requiring authentication,
-- the security model is sound. The view acts as a security barrier by design.
