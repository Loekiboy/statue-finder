# Summary of Changes - Statue Finder Optimization

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Progressive Loading of OpenStreetMap Statues (Closest First)
**File:** `src/components/MapView.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Modified the OSM statue fetching logic to load progressively in batches:
  - 2km radius (immediate surroundings)
  - 5km radius (nearby area)
  - 15km radius (wider area)
  - 50km radius (full coverage)
- Added distance calculation for each statue from user's location
- Statues are sorted by distance, showing closest first
- Map updates progressively as each batch loads
- Added 1-second delay between batches to avoid API rate limiting
- Duplicates are filtered out between batches

**Benefits:**
- Users see nearby statues much faster
- Better user experience with progressive loading
- Reduced initial loading time
- More consistent loading behavior

### 2. Setting to Hide Nijmegen Statues
**Files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251018110000_add_show_nijmegen_statues.sql` (new)
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx`
- `src/components/MapView.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added new database column `show_nijmegen_statues` (boolean, default true) to profiles table
- Updated Profile interface to include the new setting
- Added UI toggle in Profile settings page with Dutch/English labels
- Map now respects the `show_nijmegen_statues` setting
- Nijmegen statue markers are only added to map when setting is enabled

**Benefits:**
- Users can choose whether to see Nijmegen statues
- Cleaner map view for users not interested in Nijmegen statues
- Consistent with existing `show_osm_statues` pattern

### 3. Optimized QuickUploadDialog
**File:** `src/components/QuickUploadDialog.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added loading state (`isNavigating`) to provide feedback during navigation
- Buttons are disabled while navigating to prevent double-clicks
- Added visual feedback text showing navigation in progress
- Improved user experience with immediate response

**Benefits:**
- Faster perceived performance
- Prevents accidental double-submissions
- Better user feedback
- More responsive interface

### 4. Technical Improvements
- Fixed TypeScript lint errors (replaced `any` types with proper interfaces)
- Added missing dependencies to useEffect hooks
- Improved type safety in OSM statue data handling
- Updated distance field in OSMStatue interface

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/MapView.tsx` - Progressive loading, Nijmegen toggle
2. `src/components/QuickUploadDialog.tsx` - Loading state optimization
3. `src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Nijmegen statue setting UI
4. `supabase/migrations/20251018110000_add_show_nijmegen_statues.sql` - Database schema

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test progressive loading by monitoring network requests in browser DevTools
2. Verify that closest statues appear first on the map
3. Test the Nijmegen statues toggle in Profile settings
4. Verify map updates when toggling settings
5. Test QuickUploadDialog navigation and loading states
6. Test on both mobile and desktop devices
7. Verify backwards compatibility with existing profiles

## Database Migration
The migration adds a new column to the profiles table. This is backwards compatible as it has a default value of `true`, meaning existing users will continue to see Nijmegen statues until they explicitly disable them.

## Performance Impact
- **Initial load:** Slightly faster as only 2km radius is loaded first
- **Progressive loading:** Users see nearby statues within seconds instead of waiting for all statues
- **Memory:** Slightly higher due to incremental updates, but minimal impact
- **Network:** More API calls but smaller payloads per call, better overall experience

## Browser Compatibility
All changes use standard JavaScript/TypeScript features and are compatible with:
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
